<br/>
* The invasion deck is unlimited, so no need for any complex gameplay mechanics other than the fairly simple rules.

## How to Play
### Getting Started
* Make sure you have a full deck of cards, if not more.
* Every player must begin with 10 cards each as their starting deck.
* For every face card you have, count that as one protectorate.
* For every ace you have, count that as one army.
* Every card you have in your deck counts as one exarchate.
* Begin pulling cards out of the invasion deck, a deck made up of cards not belonging to any of the players.

### Game Rules
* If your card value is less than that of the card from the invasion deck, you may either use a strategem, or concede the card to the invasion deck by putting it in a random place within the invasion deck.
* If your card value is higher, you are awarded the enemy card.
* If your card's value is the same as the invasion deck's card, consider it a draw and continue onto the next turn.

### Strategems 
* Double Guarding is the act of using two protectorates in order to defeat an army from the invasion deck. After two protectorates are used, one random card from your deck must be given to the invasion deck. The enemy card must be an ace in order for Double Guarding to happen.
* Using Armies is the act of using an ace at any time, with the drawback that said Ace must be conceded to the invasion deck afterwards.
